This will flicker 5 LEDs, giving them the appearance of fire.

They're connected to analogWrite ports 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11 on the Arduino.

Adjust the value in random() to differ how much you'd like them to vary
Also, consider adjusting the delay() for a different 'flickering effect.

Super simple, clean code, etc.  Have fun.
